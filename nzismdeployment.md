# New Zealand ISM Restricted Azure Blueprint
![banner]

<br/>

## Overview
One of the challenges that government agencies have in their transition from a traditional on premises style data center to a public cloud data center is ensuring that compliance to specific security and regulatory standards is maintained.  In an on premises world the patterns for compliance are well established, and have cadences that can be controlled through defined change and assessment process.  These processes also have timelines that can wait for capability or people to be available, and wrap around technology that has a long runway for change because the agency or their service provider controls the pace of change.  In the public cloud world the pace of change is a lot faster and does not wait for any single customer to be ready, so the process for assessing compliance, and ensuring services are built in a compliant way needs to move just as quickly.

In New Zealand, our government agency responsible for establishing the guidelines is the [GCSB] (Government Communications Security Bureau) and they have established a standard that agencies must adhere to depending on the classification level of the information being stored in the platform.  They have recognized that as the government heads to a more [Digital][NZGovDigital] strategy, the standards, compliance and methods must move apace to ensure that the government can move faster while maintaining security standards.  Alongside this, the complexity and breadth of security threats is outside the capability of many agencies to respond to individually, creating a risk for all of government.

> [Digital][NZGovDigital] is about more than new technologies and improving IT systems. It also means doing things differently using new mindsets, skills, data and technologies to overcome barriers and better meet New Zealandâ€™s needs.

Microsoft has worked with many customers to produce artifacts that enable them to work safely in public cloud environments.  These include documented processes for establishing good practice for [development][AppArch], [landing zone][LZ] design patterns, and frameworks for [Cloud Adoption][CAF].  We have also worked with government to help establish patterns to assess compliance for Azure environments, and the published those to be consumable via the Azure Portal.  Those objects are our [Azure Blueprints][AzureBP], [Azure Policies][AzurePolicy] and [Azure Policy Initiatives][AzurePolicyInit].

We also published a set of tenets to improve the quality of a workload once it has been established in Azure called the [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework][WAF].  The framework consists of five pillars of architecture excellence: Cost Optimization, Operational Excellence, Performance Efficiency, Reliability, and Security.

An area that both NZ Government and Microsoft recognised that could assist New Zealand agencies and companies in cloud adoption was a translation of the NZ ISM Restricted into a set of policies that could allow the implementor a method of measuring their environment against the standard defined by the NZ ISM.  To that end, Microsoft and the GCSB worked together to establish an Azure Policy Initiative and Azure Blueprint to be published in the Azure gallery.  This allows any agency or New Zealand company to apply the standard to their Azure environment, and assess their level of compliance against a defined NZ Government standard.

The outcome of this is creating a known good baseline that every agency can adhere to, raising the base level of security across all New Zealand government.  As this is also policy as code, the process for updating and adjusting to a fast moving threat landscape becomes easier, ensuring that the risk can be reduced.  As this baseline is publicly available in the Azure gallery, New Zealand business can also adopt it, raising the bar across all of New Zealand.

## What is an Azure Blueprint?

Just as a blueprint allows an engineer or an architect to sketch a project's design parameters, Azure Blueprints enables cloud architects and central information technology groups to define a repeatable set of Azure resources that implements and adheres to an organization's standards, patterns, and requirements. Azure Blueprints makes it possible for development teams to rapidly build and stand up new environments with trust they're building within organizational compliance with a set of built-in components, such as networking, to speed up development and delivery.

Azure Blueprints can be comprised of some or all of the following objects:
* [Resource Groups][AzureRG]
* [ARM Templates][ARMTemplate]
* [Policy Assignments][AzurePolicy]
* [Role Assignments][AzureRBAC]

This allows an organisation to ensure that all resources confirm to an agreed standard of configuration or ensure that new environments are created in a repeatable and automated fashion, reducing human error and ensuring compliance to a standard.  A good example of this would be an Azure Blueprint that contains all of the required components and configuration to allow resources in a subscription to connect to the core production network, RBAC rules to ensure only the right roles have access to specific components and Azure Policies to enforce specific security or configuration rules.  This means that as a new subscription is added to an agencies Azure environment, it is automatically configured to a known good standard.

## What is a Policy Initiative?
Azure Policy evaluates resources in Azure by comparing the properties of those resources to business rules. These business rules, described in JSON format, are known as policy definitions. To simplify management, several business rules can be grouped together to form a [policy initiative][AzurePolicyInit]. Once your business rules have been formed, the policy definition or initiative is assigned to any scope of resources that Azure supports, such as management groups, subscriptions, resource groups, or individual resources. The assignment applies to all resources within the Resource Manager scope of that assignment. Subscopes can be excluded, if necessary. For more information, see [Scope in Azure Policy][AzurePolicyScope].

Multiple policies can be deployed against the same subscriptions.  Agencies that must adhere to government regulation, industry regulation and their own internal policies can layer them to ensure that they adhere to all.  You can also disable enforcement on some, to ensure that you are reporting on compliance only and reducing the complexity of layers of enforcement.  [Planning policy layering][AzurePolEvaluate] in this way requires some thought and design to ensure there is no policy collision but a simple way to manage it is to use naming conventions on the policy objects to identify which ones you are enforcing and which ones you are not.  Disabling enforcement mode is also a good way of testing the impact of new settings.

If you are also training your engineers to understand DevOps workflows, managing policy via code repository is a good way of starting them on that journey.  You can manage your Policy templates as code in a repo of your choice, and deploy it directly [to Azure using a DevOps pipeline][AzurePolascode].

All Azure Policy data and objects are encrypted at rest. For more information, see [Azure data encryption at rest][AzureDataRest].

## How to deploy the NZ ISM Restricted blueprint and policy initiative

First we need to create the resource in your tenant so we can apply it to management groups and\or subscriptions.

### Create blueprint definition
1. Select All services in the left pane. Search for and select Blueprints.
2. From the Getting started page on the left, select the Create button under Create a blueprint.
3. In the Other Samples field type New Zealand and click on the New Zealand ISM Restricted sample.
4. In the Blueprint Name field type a name for your blueprint - this is the name you will use to identify it within your tenant (e.g. NZISM)
5. Click the ellipsis button next to the Definition Location button and select a location for your blueprint to exist.  This is important in that it can only be applied to management groups and subscriptions down the tree from its location.  By default, click Tenant Root Group and click Select to ensure it can be applied at all levels.
6. Click Next:Artifacts
7. This screen shows the individual artifacts that comprise this blueprint.  At this point, you can add further artifacts in if desired.
8. Select Save Draft when you've finished reviewing the blueprint sample.

This step creates a copy of the NZISM blueprint definition in the selected management group or subscription. The saved blueprint definition is managed like any blueprint created from scratch.

### Publish the NZISM blueprint
1. Select the Blueprint definitions page on the left. 
2. Click on the NZISM blueprint
3. Click Publish blueprint
4. Enter a version number such as 1.0 and click Publish

### Assign the NZISM blueprint
1. Select the Blueprint definitions page on the left of the Azure Blueprints main screen
2. Click on the NZISM blueprint
3. Click Assign Blueprint
4. Select the subscriptions you want this blueprint to be assigned
5. In the Assignment Name field type a unique name for this assignment
6. In the Location field select Australia East
7. Select the version you created
8. Leave the Lock Assignment on Dont Lock (for more information on this setting see [Resource Lock Assignment][AzureResLock])

At this point, scroll down and you will see each individual policy item that is contained in the blueprint, along with its setting.  Some of these settings are configurable as an Option, and some require configuration before you can publish the blueprint. These are the items you must configure before moving on:
* List of users that must be included in Windows VM Administrators group
* List of users that must be excluded from Windows VM Administrators group
* Log Analytics workspace ID for VM agent reporting

This is the list of items that are optional - there are 3 of each of the following settings and they pertain to Log analytics agent deployment and Guest Configuration agent in Virtual Machines and Virtual Machine Scale Sets.  See the [Built-in Policy Definitions][AzurePolicyBuiltin] page for more information.
* Optional: List of custom VM images that have supported Windows OS to add to scope additional to the images in the gallery
* Optional: List of custom VM images that have supported Linux OS to add to scope additional to the images in the gallery

9. Click Assign

This will now deploy the artifacts in the Azure Blueprint to the target subscription.  In this case the Policy Initiative for NZ ISM Restricted will be applied.

### Deploy the Policy Initiative on its own

In some cases, you may want to just deploy the Policy Initiative instead of the blueprint.  This could be because you do not need all of the contents of the blueprint, and just need to report on compliance against the policy.  If you want to deploy the initiative on its own to a specific location instead of the blueprint use these instructions.

1. Select All services in the left pane. Search for and select Policy.
2. Click on Definitions
3. In the Search field type New Zealand and the New Zealand ISM Restricted policy should be listed
4. Click the ellipsis at the end of the line and select Assign
5. Set the scope by selecting the Subscription this policy will apply to - alternatively you can apply it to a Management group to ensure it applies to all subscriptions
> Note: The Policy Enforcement switch here allows you to disable any Enforcement policies and only return compliance if required.  At the time of writing all explicit deny policies had been removed from this template as it is primarily designed to report on compliance, and not enforce, a specific security template.  This is also a good way of testing the impact of new policies.
6. Click Parameters.  Some of these parameters are configurable as an Option, and some require configuration before you can publish the blueprint. These are the items you must configure before moving on:
* List of users that must be included in Windows VM Administrators group
* List of users that must be excluded from Windows VM Administrators group
* List of resource types that should have diagnostic logs enabled
* Log Analytics workspace ID for VM agent reporting

This is the list of items that are optional - there are 3 of each of the following settings and they pertain to Log analytics agent deployment and Guest Configuration agent in Virtual Machines and Virtual Machine Scale Sets.  See the [Built-in Policy Definitions][AzurePolicyBuiltin] page for more information.
* Optional: List of custom VM images that have supported Windows OS to add to scope additional to the images in the gallery
* Optional: List of custom VM images that have supported Linux OS to add to scope additional to the images in the gallery

7. Click Review and Create.  Notice on this last screen the specific settings that require input are listed here in the Parameters section along with your entries.  Its a good way to ensure you have configured the correct parameters.
8. Click Create.

## How to measure compliance

Once the policy has deployed it takes some time to review all the resources and assess compliance.  Once complete, you can review this in the core Policy screen

<img src="images/policy.png" alt="Policy" title="Policy" width="50%" />

On the overview screen, click on the NZ ISM Policy to open the Initiative Compliance dashboard

<img src="images/policy1.png" alt="Policy" title="Policy" width="50%" />

You should see an overview of compliance, with the non-compliant controls listed below.  If you click on one of the non-compliant controls it will take you to a detail screen explaining the NZ ISM control that is non-compliant (with a link to read more).  If you click on Policies it will show the Azure Policies that are linked to this control, and which ones are not compliant.  If you click on Resource Compliance this shows the specific resources that are not meeting the required policy.

## How to remediate

Some policies have automated remediation tasks you can kick off from the Policy console.  From the Initiative Compliance dashboard, click on Create Remediation Task at the top of the screen.
In the drop down box this will list the specific policies you can Remediate (e.g. Deploy Dependency agent for Windows virtual machines)
It will also list the Resources this remediation task will apply to, so when you click Remediate it will initiate the task on all of those resources.  In the screenshot below, this is an example of deploying the dependency agent for a non-compliant Windows machine.

<img src="images/remediation.png" alt="Policy" title="Policy" width="50%" />

## How to override

For some environments or resources, some policies or configurations may not be valid or required.  Examples of this might be where you are achieving compliance through a different method like monitoring VM resources through the use of a 3rd party security system.  If thats the case, you can override the specific control permanently or for a defined term with an explanation.  This ensure the override process is auditable and reportable.

From the Initiative Compliance dashboard, click on Create Exemption Task at the top of the screen
This walks you through a series of screens to configure the category and expiration of the Exemption, and the specific scope and policies that this exemption covers.

## How to keep up to date

As feedback is received from the community, and as new policy settings are developed and the NZ ISM evolves to address new threats, so will the sample template change.  To keep up to date, you can simply redeploy the new version of the blueprint or Policy Initiative in the same way that you have previously deployed it, and remove the old version.  It is recommended that you follow the Microsoft recommended practice for Policy deployment.

![AzurePolicyWorkflow]

Using Azure DevOps to check in the code, version it and deploy it to Azure is an automated and auditable process that is highly recommended to streamline this process.

## Coming soon!

Based on feedback we have already received we are working on bringing the NZ ISM to the Security Center reporting for Regulatory Compliance.  This will allow organisations to export the report as a CSV or PDF if required.  [See here for more information on how this works][SecurityCenterRegComp].

## Feedback
An important aspect of this blueprint and the policy initiative is to establish a feedback loop between the government agencies, the policy creators and the technology partners.  Working together as a community will ensure that as our technology evolves, so does the governance and management strategy.  It also means that all participants can leverage the shared learnings from establishment through to consumption.

We welcome feedback on things that can improve the artifact's we have published.  Microsoft will be working with the NZ Government to continue to update the Policy Initiative in future to ensure the Azure gallery items stay in step with the standards published by the NZ government.

To that end, for all feedback or questions on the NZ ISM Restricted Azure Blueprint and the Policy Initiative, please feel free to contact me at bevan.sinclair@microsoft.com, or simply talk to your Microsoft account team who can assist.  For feedback on the NZ ISM Restricted standard itself please send all requests to nzism@gcsb.govt.nz.

Any items that merit more discussion, or we identify as items that the community would benefit with more in depth understanding can be found in the other markdown document [NZ ISM Discussion][NZISMDiscussion]

## Thanks to
This work has been and continues to be a team effort so thanks to the staff at the New Zealand GCSB and NCSC, the agencies who gave their time to pilot the policies, and the internal Microsoft team.  Together we are all working towards setting a great baseline of security for all of New Zealand in the (long white) Cloud.  Also thanks to the Linked In community who have proffered valuable insights and shared the content (@davidwhitenz at Theta!).
